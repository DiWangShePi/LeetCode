# 133. Clone Graph

### Description

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

```c++
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```
 

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

###### c++

```c++
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> neighbors;
    Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<Node*, Node*> visited;
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return node;
        }

        if (visited.find(node) != visited.end()) {
            return visited[node];
        }
        
        Node* cloneNode = new Node(node->val);
        visited[node] = cloneNode;

        for (auto& neighbor: node->neighbors) {
            cloneNode->neighbors.emplace_back(cloneGraph(neighbor));
        }
        return cloneNode;
    }
};
```
